## 📊 Introduction

Interpretable machine learning has gained significant prominence across various fields including geography, remote sensing, and urban planning. Machine learning models are valued for their robust capability to capture complex relationships within data through sophisticated fitting algorithms. Complementing these models, interpretability frameworks based on game theory—such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)—provide essential tools for revealing such "black-box" models. These interpretable approaches deliver critical insights by ranking feature importance, identifying nonlinear response thresholds, and analyzing interaction relationships between factors.

Despite these advantages, implementing interpretable machine learning workflows remains a complex and time-intensive process, particularly for those new to the field. There exists a notable gap in comprehensive, user-friendly tooling for executing these workflows efficiently. The mymodels project addresses this gap by automating the interpretable machine learning process, significantly reducing implementation time while maintaining analytical rigor.


## 👨‍🎓 Prerequisites for Beginners

1. 💡 **Python Proficiency**

    Recommended resource:

    - [Python tutorial on W3SCHOOL](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

    Essential contents:
    - Basic
    - Object-oriented Development (OOP)
    - Some commonly used Python built-in modules
    
    **DO REMEMBER**: Make a practical demo project after you finish the above learning to enhance what you have learned (i.e., a tiny web crawler). [Here is one of my practice projects](https://github.com/gtzjh/WundergroundSpider)

2. 💡 **Machine Learning Fundamentals**

    [Stanford CS229](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) provides essential theoretical foundations.

3. 🛠️ **Technical Skills**

    - Environment management with conda/pip
    - Terminal/Command Line proficiency
    - Version control with Git ([My note of learning Git](https://github.com/gtzjh/learngit))

## 🛠️ Environment Setup (Windows, same for Linux and macOS)

### Create environment

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.10
- 1.75 GB available disk space

```bash
conda env create -f requirement.yml -n mymodels -y
```

---

### Activate environment

```base
conda activate mymodels
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

We take `run_titanic.py` as an example:


### Import the package.

```python
from mymodels.pipeline import MyPipeline
```

---

### Construct an object for workflow. 

The created instance here named mymodel.

- **results_dir**: Directory path where your results will be stored. Accepts either a string or pathlib.Path object. The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

- **random_state**: Random seed for the entire pipeline (data splitting, model tuning, etc.). (Default is 0)

- **show**: Whether to display the figure on the screen. (Default is `False`)

- **plot_format**: Output format for figures. (Default is jpg)

- **plot_dpi**: Controlling the resolution of output figures. (Default is 500)

```python
mymodel = MyPipeline(
    results_dir = "results/titanic",
    random_state = 0,
    show = False,
    plot_format = "jpg",
    plot_dpi = 500
)
```

---

### Load data

- **file_path**: In which the data you want to input. **.csv format is mandatory**. 

- **y**: The target you want to predict. A `str` object represented column name or a `int` object represented the column index are both acceptable.

- **x_list**: A `list` object (or a `tuple` object) of the independent variables. Each element in `list` (or `tuple`) must be a `str` object represented column name or a `int` object represented the column index.

- **index_col**: An `int` object or `str` object representing the index column. It's STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to set the index column if you want to output the raw data and the shap values. Also, it's acceptable to provide a `list` object (or a `tuple` object) for representing multiple index columns. (Default is `None`)

- **test_ratio**: The proportion of test data. (Default is 0.3)

- **inspect**: Whether to display the y column or the independent variables you chose in the terminal. (Default is `True`)

```python
mymodel.load(
    file_path = "data/titanic.csv",
    y = "Survived",
    x_list = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Embarked", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare"],
    index_col = ["PassengerId", "Name"],
    test_ratio = 0.3,
    inspect = False
)
```

---

### Execute the optimization

- **model_name**: the model you want to use. In this example, `xgbc` represented XGBoost classifier, other model name like `catr` means CatBoost regressor. A full list of model names representing different models and tasks can be found at the end.

- **cat_features**: A `list` (or a `tuple`) of categorical features to specify for model. A `list` (or a `tuple`) of `str` representing the column names or `int` representing the index of column are both acceptable. (Default is `None`)

- **encode_method**: A `str` object representing the encode method, or a `list` (or a `tuple`) of encode methods are both acceptable.

  If the `cat_features` is presented, and the `model_name` is not `catr` or `catc`, then the `encode_method` must be presented

  If a single encode method is presented (like below, only `onehot` encode method is presented), it will be implemented to all categorical features (as listed in `encode_method`); 

  If a `list` (or a `tuple`) of encode methods is presented, i.e. `["onehot", "binary", "target"]`, they will be implemented to the three categorical features respectively.

  A full list of supported encode methods can be found at the end.

  (Default is `None`)

- **cv**: Cross-validation in the tuning process. (Default is 5)

- **trials**: How many trials in the Bayesian tuning process (Based on [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)). (Default is 50)

- **n_jobs**: How many cores will be used in the cross-validation process. It's recommended to use the same value as `cv`. (Default is 5)

- **optimize_history**: Whether to save the optimization history. (Default is `True`)

- **save_optimal_params**: Whether to save the best parameters. (Default is `True`)

- **save_optimal_model**: Whether to save the optimal model. (Default is `True`)

    Several files will be output in the results directory:

    - `params.yml` will document the best parameters.

    - `mapping.json` will document the mapping relationship between the categorical features and the encoded features.
    
    - `optimal-model.joblib` will save the optimal model from sklearn.

    - `optimal-model.cbm` will save the optimal model from CatBoost.

    - `optimal-model.txt` will save the optimal model from LightGBM.

    - `optimal-model.json` will save the optimal model from XGBoost.

    - `optimal-model.pkl` will save all types of optimal model for compatibility.


```python
mymodel.optimize(
    model_name = "xgbc",
    cat_features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Embarked"],
    encode_method = "onehot",
    cv = 5,
    trials = 10,
    n_jobs = 5,
    optimize_history = True,
    save_optimal_params = True,
    save_optimal_model = True
)
```

---

### Evaluate the model's accuracy.

- **save_raw_data**: Whether to save the raw prediction data. Default is `True`.

    The accuracy results will be output to the directory you defined above:

    - A `.yml` file named `accuracy` will document the results of model's accuracy.

    - A figure named `roc_curve_plot` document the classification accuracy.

    - Or a figure named `accuracy_plot` (it is a scatter plot) for regression task.


```python
mymodel.evaluate(save_raw_data = True)
```

---

### Explain the model using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):

- **select_background_data**: The data used for **background value calculation**. Default is `"train"`, meaning that all data in the training set will be used. `"test"` means that all data in the test set will be used. `"all"` means that all data in the training and test set will be used. (Default is `"train"`)

- **select_shap_data**: The data used for **calculating SHAP values**. Default is `"test"`, meaning that all data in the test set will be used. `"all"` means that all data in the training and test set will be used. (Default is `"test"`)

- **sample_background_data_k**: Sampling the samples in the training set for **background value calculation**. Default `None`, meaning that all data in the training set will be used. An integer value means an actual number of data, while a float (i.e., 0.5) means the proportion in the training set for it. (Default is `None`)

- **sample_shap_data_k**: Similar meaning to the `sample_background_data_k`. The test set will be implemented for **SHAP value calculation**. (Default is `None`)

- **output_raw_data**: Whether to save the raw data. Default is `False`.

The figures (Summary plot, Dependence plots) will be output to the directory you defined above.


```python
mymodel.explain(
    select_background_data = "train",
    select_shap_data = "test",
    sample_background_data_k = 50,
    sample_shap_data_k = 50,
    output_raw_data = True
)
```
