# Welcome to mymodels

Interpretable machine learning has gained significant prominence across various fields. Machine learning models are valued for their robust capability to capture complex relationships within data through sophisticated fitting algorithms. Complementing these models, interpretability frameworks provide essential tools for revealing such "black-box" models. These interpretable approaches deliver critical insights by ranking feature importance, identifying nonlinear response thresholds, and analyzing interaction relationships between factors. 

Project `mymodels`, is targeting on building a **tiny, user-friendly, and efficient** workflow, for the scientific researchers and students who are seeking to implement interpretable machine learning in their their research works.
